## Getting Started
[Back to top](#graphql-an-introduction-demo)
### Installing Dependencies
```shell
npm install
```

### Running The Server
```shell
npm run start
```
Once the server is running it will log the url's that 
you can visit to try out GraphQL.

### Run a Query
There is one demo query included in the server, to run 
the query paste the following into the playground.
```graphql
query {
  hello
}
```
### Run a Mutation
There is one demo mutation included in the server, to 
run the mutation paste the following into the playground.
```graphql
mutation {
  whatsYourName (name: "John")
}
```
### Run a Subscription
There is one demo mutation included in the server, to 
run the mutation paste the following into the playground.
```graphql
subscription {
  pushUserNames (id: 1)
}
```
However you will notice that nothing actually happens, this
is because we are using Pub-Subs, so you will need to open a
new window in the playground and run the following mutation.
```graphql
mutation {
  whatsYourName (name: "John", id: 1)
}
```

## Code Explanation
[Back to top](#graphql-an-introduction-demo)
### Query Code
```js
// src/query.js
const query = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Query',
  description: 'Base Query Object',
  fields: () => ({
    hello: {
      type: GraphQLString,
      description: 'Hello World!',
      resolve: async () => {
        return 'World!'
      },
    },
  }),
})
```
In [query.js](https://github.com/nslandolt/graphql-an-introduction-demo/blob/master/src/query.js)
we create the base or root query. A root type is required for any subsequent field (i.e. queries).
We start off by declaring a new `GraphQLObjectType` and start filling out the various fields such as
`name`, and `description`. When we reach the `fields` field, we create an anonymous function that returns
the different queries. In this example it is not required however later on as you expand your schema, you 
may have types that include other types, but those children types then return the original type so it will
cause issues when generating the schema, the anonymous function solves this issue. So now we start creating
the fields that can be queried, to keep it simple there is only one field `hello` that when queried will
resolve and return `World!` when executed.

### Mutation Code
```js
// src/mutations.js
const mutation = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Mutation',
  description: 'Base Mutation Object',
  fields: () => ({
    whatsYourName: {
      type: GraphQLString,
      description: 'A simple mutation to demo its functionality.',
      args: {
        name: {
          type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString),
          description: 'User\'s name.',
        },
        id: {
          type: GraphQLID,
          description: 'The ID used for sending name through subscription.',
        },
      },            /* source    args          context */
      resolve: async (_source, { id, name }, { pubsub }) => {
        pubsub.publish(id, { name })
        return `Your name is: ${name}!`
      },
    },
  }),
})
```
In [mutation.js](https://github.com/nslandolt/graphql-an-introduction-demo/blob/master/src/mutation.js)
again like the query above we have to create the root mutation. We follow the same pattern as the query
above with the `name`, `description`, and `fields`. Here however we also the `args` field to the mutation
this field allows us to accept arguments from the user. (Note: args are also available with queries however
in this example they were not needed.) So since we define the schema in GraphQL we must define the arguments
as well. Arguments follow the same pattern as defining `mutations` or `queries` we have to provide the type
and a description, you can also see `GraphQLNonNull` being used this ensures that the argument cannot be left
empty or provided a null value. In the mutation resolver here you can see that it is a bit more complex than
the one being used in the [query](#query-code), we are accessing the various objects that are passed to the
resolver. The important things that we are looking for is the second and third argument, the second argument
represents the arguments object and contains all the information passed in by the user whereas the third
argument represents the context that is generated in the [server](#server-code). We can destruct this objects
and pull out the individual variables thanks to the power of JavaScript. You will also notice the `pubsub`
that we are pulling out of the context which we will use this later on in the subscription, and finally you will
see that we return a template string (matching the return type) containing a message to the requesting user.

### Subscription Code
```js
// src/subscription.js
const subscription = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Subscription',
  description: 'Base Subscription',
  fields: () => ({
    pushUserNames: {
      type: GraphQLString,
      description: 'Demo subscription example.',
      args: {
        id: {
          type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLID),
          description: 'The ID of used by the mutation.',
        },
      },
      resolve: async ({ name }) => {
        return name
      },        /* source    args    context */
      subscribe: (_source, { id }, { pubsub }) => pubsub.asyncIterator(id),
    },
  }),
})
```
In [subscription.js](https://github.com/nslandolt/graphql-an-introduction-demo/blob/master/src/subscription.js)
we once again follow the same pattern of declaring the base object, the sub fields etc. However there is one key
difference which lies in the last field `subscribe`, this is a special field reserved for subscriptions. Just 
like a resolver we can access the same objects and use them inside the anonymous function. For subscriptions 
we typically use a PubSub engine specifically designed for a certain system, you can see my demo using redis
[here](https://github.com/nslandolt/graphql-redis-subscription-demo), but for this demo we are keeping it simple
and using just a default engine. We use the pubsub that was created in the [servers](#server-code) context just
like we did in the [mutation](#mutation-code) above, but this time we are accessing the `asyncIterator` function.
We pass the `asyncIterator` an ID assigned by the user which if any data is pushed to this pubsub use the `publish`
method it will pass that data directly to the resolver and push the information to the user via web sockets.

### Server Code
```js
const { query } = require('./query')
const { mutation } = require('./mutation')
const { subscription } = require('./subscription')

const Server = (port, context = {}) => {
  const app = express()

  const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: new GraphQLSchema({
      query: query,
      mutation: mutation,
      subscription: subscription,
    }),
    context: ({ req, res }) => {
      return {
        req,
        res,
        ...context,
      }
    },
  })

  server.applyMiddleware({ app })

  const httpServer = createServer(app)

  server.installSubscriptionHandlers(httpServer)

  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:${port}${server.graphqlPath}`)
  console.log(
    `ðŸš€ Subscriptions ready at ws://localhost:${port}${server.subscriptionsPath}`,
  )
  return httpServer
}
```
[Server.js](https://github.com/nslandolt/graphql-an-introduction-demo/blob/master/src/server.js) is
where we create a factory function that returns an http server that we can serve to the user and 
make requests on. We first need to include all of the previously created graphql objects so that
we can build our schema. I've decided to use [ApolloServer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)
combined with [apollo-server-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-express) to serve
the GraphQL server. Our server

### Entrypoint Code
```js
const PORT = 3000

const { Server } = require('./src/server')

;(async () => {
  const pubsub = new PubSub()

  Server(PORT, { pubsub }).listen(PORT, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err
  })
})()
```
