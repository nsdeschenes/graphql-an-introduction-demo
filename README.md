### Installing Dependencies
```shell
npm install
```

### Running The Server
```shell
npm run start
```
Once the server is running it will log the url's that you can
visit to try out GraphQL.

## Running Queries/Mutations/Subscriptions
### Run a Query
There is one demo query included in the server, to run the query
paste the following into the playground.
```graphql
query {
  hello
}
```
### Run a Mutation
There is one demo mutation included in the server, to 
run the mutation paste the following into the playground.
```graphql
mutation {
  whatsYourName (name: "John")
}
```
### Run a Subscription
There is one demo mutation included in the server, to 
run the mutation paste the following into the playground.
```graphql
subscription {
  pushUserNames (id: 1)
}
```
However you will notice that nothing actually happens, this
is because we are using Pub-Subs, so you will need to open a
new window in the playground and run the following mutation.
```graphql
mutation {
  whatsYourName (name: "John", id: 1)
}
```

### Query Code
```js
// src/query.js
const query = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Query',
  description: 'Base Query Object',
  fields: () => ({
    hello: {
      type: GraphQLString,
      description: 'Hello World!',
      resolve: async () => {
        return 'World!'
      },
    },
  }),
})
```

### Mutation Code
```js
// src/mutations.js
const mutation = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Mutation',
  description: 'Base Mutation Object',
  fields: () => ({
    whatsYourName: {
      type: GraphQLString,
      description: 'A simple mutation to demo its functionality.',
      args: {
        name: {
          type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString),
          description: 'User\'s name.',
        },
        id: {
          type: GraphQLID,
          description: 'The ID used for sending name through subscription.',
        },
      },
      resolve: async (_source, { id, name }, { pubsub }) => {
        pubsub.publish(id, { name })
        return `Your name is: ${name}!`
      },
    },
  }),
})
```

### Subscription Code
```js
// src/subscription.js
const subscription = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: 'Subscription',
  description: 'Base Subscription',
  fields: () => ({
    pushUserNames: {
      type: GraphQLString,
      description: 'Demo subscription example.',
      args: {
        id: {
          type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLID),
          description: 'The ID of used by the mutation.',
        },
      },
      resolve: async ({ name }) => {
        return name
      },
      subscribe: (_, { id }, { pubsub }) => pubsub.asyncIterator(id),
    },
  }),
})
```
### Server Code
```js
const { query } = require('./query')
const { mutation } = require('./mutation')
const { subscription } = require('./subscription')

const Server = (port, context = {}) => {
  const app = express()

  app.get('/alive', (_req, res) => {
    res.json({ ok: 'yes' })
  })
  app.get('/ready', (_req, res) => {
    res.json({ ok: 'yes' })
  })

  const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: new GraphQLSchema({
      query: query,
      mutation: mutation,
      subscription: subscription,
    }),
    context: ({ req, res }) => {
      return {
        req,
        res,
        ...context,
      }
    },
  })

  server.applyMiddleware({ app })

  const httpServer = createServer(app)

  server.installSubscriptionHandlers(httpServer)

  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:${port}${server.graphqlPath}`)
  console.log(
    `ðŸš€ Subscriptions ready at ws://localhost:${port}${server.subscriptionsPath}`,
  )
  return httpServer
}
```
